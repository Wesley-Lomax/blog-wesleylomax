The Sitecore Most Valuable Professional (MVP) awards for 2018 have been announced and I am thrilled to be amongst the list of Sitecore Most Valuable Professionals for 2018 having been awarded the **Sitecore Most Valuable Professional Technology Award**.

Being one of the 208 Technology MVPs recognised this year makes it three years in a row I have been recognised as a Technology MVP by Sitecore an achievement that brings me great pride.

Now it its 12th year, Sitecore’s MVP program recognizes individual technology, strategy, and commerce advocates who share their Sitecore passion and expertise to offer positive customer experiences that drive business results. The Sitecore MVP Award recognizes the most active Sitecore experts from around the world who participate in online and offline communities to share their knowledge with other Sitecore partners and customers.

> “The Sitecore MVP awards recognize and honor those individuals who make substantial contributions to our loyal community of partners and customers,” said Pieter Brinkman, Sitecore Senior Director of Technical Marketing. “MVPs consistently set a standard of excellence by delivering technical chops, enthusiasm, and a commitment to giving back to the Sitecore community. They truly understand and deliver on the power of the Sitecore Experience Platform to create personalized brand experiences for their consumers, driving revenue and customer loyalty.”

Thanks to all at Sitecore who run the MVP Program and many congratulations to all Sitecore MVP&#8217;s for 2018. The full list of 2018 MVP&#8217;s is available here &#8211; <a href="https://mvp.sitecore.net/mvps/2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mvp.sitecore.net/mvps/2018 </a>
