I am a Freelance Sitecore Architect / Consultant who has worked almost exclusively with Sitecore since 2012, this year I was honored to have been awarded [Sitecore Technology Most Valuable Professional (MVP) 2016][1].

I&#8217;ve worked on Sitecore projects from version 6.4 through to 8.2 and have built solutions for customers across all sectors from travel to cosmetics, legal to banking and worked with some of the UK and Europe&#8217;s largest Sitecore partners.

I have 12 years experience in the IT world and 10 years experience with .Net development. The last 5 years have been all about Web Content Management Systems mainly Sitecore and Umbraco.

I am a Sitecore, Umbraco and Microsoft Certified Professional Developer and will be using this blog to share my thoughts and findings from my day to day experience in the software development world.
